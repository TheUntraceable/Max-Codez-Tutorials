# **MaxCodez**'s Projects.
* Here you will find a list of **all MaxCodez** tutorials code.
* This code should work without a doubt, if you are getting **NameError**'s you should change the variables name to what you have defined, for example: 
```
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
client = commands.Bot(command_prefix="/")
bot.run("Token") # This wil raise NameError because bot is not defined.
```
## Where is the code?
* You can find the code in the branches, the name of the video being the branch title.
    * **Note:** Not all branches are complete yet, please keep in mind that as of right now only, `The Untraceable#4852` and `quack#4444` are contributing. Thanks!
## I want to contribute, how?
If you want to contribute, please make a pull request and if it is correct then we will merge. If we do not find that the code is correct or seems malicious (apart from the spammer videos) we will fix the code and give the fixed code back to you, and then you shall make a pull request again as I, `The Untraceable#4852`, credit should be given where credit is due. 

**Note:** you will not receive any reward other than the fact that you have been credited inside of the branch.
#### Todo list:
1. Actually add stuff to the branches other than the ReadMe in most branches
2. I think that's it...
